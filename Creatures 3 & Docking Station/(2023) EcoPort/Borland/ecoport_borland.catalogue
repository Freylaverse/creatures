"Borland"
"The specimen we observed on Albia was rather reclusive, and obtaining genetic samples required no small amount of patience. This cloned specimen, while genetically identical to the original, is much younger than its predecessor, and has no learned fear of being seen. Despite being offered zander fish - its preferred diet on Albia - the younger Borland seems content to filter-feed in the Ark's nutrient-rich waters, perhaps because zander fish seem to have the nutritional value of a graham cracker."
