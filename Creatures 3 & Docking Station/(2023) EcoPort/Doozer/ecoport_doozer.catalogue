"Doozer"
"Much genetic diversity was found hidden away in the DNA of the original doozers that had unfortunately been lost to time and more-dominant alleles. Doozers have a 1/5 chance of being blonde, a 1/10 chance of being albino, and a 1/100 chance of being melanistic. Of course, you only seem to start with five of them... I wonder how they reproduce?"
