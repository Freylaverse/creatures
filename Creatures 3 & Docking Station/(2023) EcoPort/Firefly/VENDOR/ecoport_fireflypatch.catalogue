"Firefly Mother"
"Holy heck! This mother of all fireflies is huge. In fact, she's grown so large that she can't fly anymore. She doesn't seem bothered by it, though. She's quite content to sit up in the jungle and survey her territory. Should she find that the firefly population has dwindled too low, she will make more!"
