"The Albian specimen of this particular plant was quite weak, due to starvation, and it is truly a wonder how it managed to survive as long as it did. This cloned specimen is much livelier and has much better aim (though it still misses its prey most of the time). It seems content to eat rocklice, mosquitoes, fireflies, and dragonflies."
