"Shee Statue"
"As part of our mission to preserve the wonders of Albia, we are committed not only to its biodiversity but to its culture as well. An impressive statue was found underground after the volcanic eruption, and we did our best to replicate it. Creatures seem transfixeed by it, perhaps to an unhealthy degree, but only when it's active."
