"Tantris Berry"
"How the native Albian tantris plant reproduced is still a mystery to us - we found no seeds of note in its fruit. However, we were successfully able to graft part of the shrub onto one of the trees in the Jungle terrarium. The fruit is a good source of vitamins, and acts as a mild aphrodisiac, however it does not possess the intoxicating properties of the native variant - perhaps due to the change in soil composition?"
