"Menorah"
"This year (2023), Hanukkah starts on December 7th, about halfway through the CCSF! I made this menorah to celebrate! Click once to set the candles, and click again to light them. They'll take some time to burn down before you can set it again. If you accidentally skip ahead, you can reset the menorah to Day 1 by Shift + Ctrl + Clicking on it."
