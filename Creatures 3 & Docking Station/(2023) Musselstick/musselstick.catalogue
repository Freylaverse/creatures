"Musselstick"
"This stick looks like bamboo, but it is actually a colonial animal more similar to coral! More importantly, it lives in a symbiotic relationship with the Albian mussel, whose eggs float dormant in most bodies of water sourced from Albia. When the stick is at least half submerged, mussels will start to grow on it. Norns can eat these!"
