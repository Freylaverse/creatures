"Grow your own mushrooms! Click on the log to change the variety of mushroom. The white mushrooms contain arnica, which helps fight against glycotoxin poisoning. The green mushrooms make grendels drowsy, but contain a powerful antihistamine for norns. Norns are likewise allergic (though not severely) to the red mushrooms, which boost a grendel's immune system. Finally, yellow mushrooms are packed full of vitamins for everyone, but relieve boredom only in ettins."
