You may or may not already have some of the image/sound dependencies required for this! I put them in a folder anyway! 

1/2/2025
- Updated the .cos file with the updated plague event and temp gadgets as seen in the CCSF 2024. Renamed the .cos file to reflect the fact that it is the 2024 Edition of the wheel. 
- Future changes will be made to a 2025 version of the wheel and so on so that old versions are still usable.
- Updated the temptoys sprite file. Reinstall this if you use the 2024 version of the wheel!

TO-DO: 
- Implement the grey button (expands the panel for "pre-set" event settings?)
- Implement more requested events
- Fix norns getting stuck in love/wartime. 
- Bug reported: When set to perform automatic spins, War Time can still occur even if disabled
