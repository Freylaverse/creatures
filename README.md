#Freylaverse's Creatures Repository

Bonjour mes amis, and welcome to my Creatures repository! I am new to Github so please bare with me. This repository is a dedicated space for all the mods I've developed for the Creatures series of games.

About 
There are three main directories, corresponding to each of the three main games: Creatures 1, Creatures 2, and Creatures 3/Docking Station. If I make anything for Creatures Village (unlikely, but not impossible!) I'll add that here too. 

Mod List (So far!)
Please note: I am a forgetful little goldfish and WILL NOT remember to update the list in the Readme when I actually add new COBS/agents.
